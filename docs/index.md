## What you will find here
- **My path to F1**  
  How I got into Formula 1, [Journey to F1](journey-to-f1.md).

- **Talks and Presentations**  
  Slide decks and supporting material for quick download after events.

- **Tools and Utilities**  
  A small **2D boundary layer meshing setup tool** for CFD, it computes BL mesh setup parameters and visualizes them so you can plug them into your meshing workflow,

- **Quick Links and References**  
  Curated links I often share with students and colleagues.

## Giving back to Formula Student
I am very grateful for my Formula Student time, I learned a lot there, and I want to pass this knowledge on to students, so that you can follow a similar path or take as much as possible from Formula Student. Supporting the community is important to me, and I am happy to help where I can.
