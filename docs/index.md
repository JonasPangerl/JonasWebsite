## About this site
This is my personal website to share resources, notes, and tools, mainly for the **Formula Student** community. I’ll post talk materials, small utilities, and pointers that might help teams with their aero and CFD workflows.

---

## What you’ll find here
- **Talks & Presentations**  
  I’ll upload slide decks and supporting material here so you can download them easily after events.

- **Tools & Utilities**  
  I wrote a small **2D boundary-layer mesh helper** for CFD: it computes BL setup parameters and visualizes them so you can plug them into your meshing workflow.

- **Quick Links & References**  
  Links I frequently share with students and colleagues.
