## About this site
This is my personal website to share resources, notes, and tools, mainly for the **Formula Student** community. You’ll find talk materials, small utilities, and references that can help with aero and CFD workflows.

---

## What you’ll find here
- **Talks & Presentations**  
  Slide decks and supporting material for quick download after events.

- **Tools & Utilities**  
  A small **2D boundary-layer mesh helper** for CFD: computes BL setup parameters and visualizes them so you can plug them into your meshing workflow.  
  [Boundary Layer Mesh Helper](boundary_layer_tool.md).

- **Quick Links & References**  
  Curated links I often share with students and colleagues.
