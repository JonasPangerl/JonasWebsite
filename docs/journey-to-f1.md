# My journey to F1

This page summarizes how I moved from curiosity about aerodynamics to working in Formula 1.

## Early interests
I was always fascinated by aerodynamics, aircraft and race cars inspired me early on.
I first considered studying aerospace engineering, it felt a bit too narrow for me, so I chose a broader path with more future options.
I studied **Mechatronics** in my bachelor but quickly realised that I enjoyed the **mechanical engineering** side the most, and also **programming**, so I steered my electives toward mechanics, aerodynamics, CFD, and applied maths.

## Studies
I continued with a **Master’s in Mechanical Engineering** at the **University of Applied Sciences Esslingen**, the same place where I did my bachelor.
I took every course I could find that touched aerodynamics, CFD, and the maths behind them. I did not plan on Formula 1 at that time, it felt unrealistic and was not a goal.

## Formula Student
During my bachelor thesis I joined **Rennstall Esslingen**, the Formula Student team of the UAS Esslingen in the **aerodynamics** group.
The year before I had designed a **Formula 1 style front wing** at home for fun and to lear how surface design works in CAD.
It is linked on the downloads page and I also published it on **GrabCAD**: <https://grabcad.com/jonas.pangerl-1/models>.

* Year 1, I worked on the **front wing** and the **diffuser**  
* Year 2, I became **aero lead**, I reworked the **STARCCM+** simulation model, automated processes and post processing, and with the team I developed a new aero concept for **2019** that performed very well and we won **Formula Student Germany 2019** with a completely new car  
* Year 3, I was involved in the early concept work on a **fan car**, the project was refined by a colleague, the next season was extremely successful, including another  **FSG win** and **World Ranking Number 1**. In that year I also reworked the CFD process a second time from scratch to make it more flexible and also much faster.
* Year 4, I reworked the **front wing** of the car with the goal to make it less ride height dependent and more **aerodynamically stable** by providing high CpT to the downstream parts of the car. The team still uses the main shapes of this wing years later

## First industry step
At **FS Spain 2019**, a judge from **Williams Racing** noticed my work in the **Engineering Design** event and Williams offered me an **internship** in the **aerodynamics** department. This year at Williams was an amazing learning experience.

## Thesis and research
I wrote my **Master’s thesis** in the **CFD** group at Williams, focusing on **high fidelity simulations** of a **Formula One wing and wheel configuration** in **OpenFOAM**, mostly **LES** and **DES**, at very high resolution (quasi DNS). I compared modelling approaches, conducted studies, and produced a dataset that Williams could reuse internally for further projects.

## Williams, aero work
After the thesis, I stayed at Williams in the **aerodynamics department**, as an aerodynamicist working on the floor. This deepened my understanding of development cycles, WT testing, correlation and robust workflow design.

## Move to Switzerland, CFD correlation
After three years at Williams I moved to **Sauber** (now AudiF1) in Switzerland and shifted my path towards **CFD**.
I now work in the **CFD correlation team**, which fits my strengths from aero development and my thesis work.
It is varied and challenging, and there is still a lot to learn from my colleagues and the people in the CFD methodology team.

## What helped most
* Fundamentals, fluid mechanics, numerics, and data analysis  
* Building things that others can see, tools, case studies 
* **Python** for scripting, automation, visualisation, documentation  
* Teamwork and ownership in **Formula Student**, leading, reviewing, iterating  
* Sharing results in a way that is easy to understand and discussing with colleagues
* Having fun doing all those things

## Practical advice for students
* Grades matter less than **skill growth** and **visible work**,  
* Learn beyond the syllabus, books, videos, open projects,  
* Use **Formula Student** to try ideas and to deliver something new,  
* Stand out with good documentation and consistent results,  
* Reach out to teams, network at events, ask for feedback, apply anyway.
