# Inside an F1 Aero Department, a Practical Sketch

This section explains how a Formula 1 aero department is structured, it gives the background of the regulations and why things are done the way they are in F1 aero, also in comparison to other industries where time, cost, and regulation constraints can be very different. The goal is to provide an overview of how the organisation typically looks, which sub departments are usually present, what the main tasks are, and which interests and skills help you work there, or help you decide if a given area could be a good fit for you.

I also want to make clear how the different groups interact, concept to CAD to CFD to wind tunnel to track, and how information flows in both directions, factory to track and back. The purpose is to give you a quick map so you can see yourself in it, and so you can better understand what to apply for when you browse F1 team career pages.

Please note, this is a sketch from my personal experience and conversations. Every team is different and this does not represent my current team.
Names differ between teams, some tasks may live in different departments, take this as a broad overview that should still help you understand how things work in general.
