# Software

The software group builds and maintains the tools that **Aero** relies on every day, they connect data from **track**, **wind tunnel**, **CFD**, and **CAD**, they store it, validate it, and make it easy to search, to compare, to visualise, and to document. Most tools are **in house**, the group responds quickly to requests from Aerodynamicists and provides **APIs** and libraries so other departments can use the same data without friction.

## Core responsibilities
* **Data ingestion**, bring telemetry, WT logs, CFD results, and CAD exports into consistent formats,
* **Storage and models**, design schemas that reflect how work happens, runs, options, references, conditions,
* **Processing and QC**, validate units and references, detect outliers, compute derived signals and deltas,
* **APIs and access**, stable services for reading and writing, good documentation and examples,
* **Applications**, web or desktop apps for search, comparison, visualisation, and reporting,
* **Automation**, scheduled jobs and event driven pipelines, predictable artefacts for engineers.

## Where software sits in the loop
Software works closely with **CFD** and **WT**, because these are the main producers of data, and with **Aero development** and 
**Aero Performance**, because these are the main consumers. The goal is one shared picture across factory and track, 
so decisions are made on the same evidence.

## Skills and profile
* Solid **software engineering** skills, clean code, tests, reviews, version control,
* **Python** for data and glue, comfort with APIs and small web apps,
* Understanding of **aero development**, enough to speak the language and to prioritise useful features,
* Interest in **data modelling** and **UX**, so engineers find things and apply them quickly.
