# Model Design

Model design engineers take the **final wetted surfaces** from Aeros and Surfacing and turn them into **wind tunnel model hardware**. The focus is not to invent shapes, it is to **scale to 60 percent**, to split intelligently, to ensure modularity and quick change times in the tunnel, to hit stiffness targets, to place instrumentation, and to deliver parts that assemble cleanly and repeatably.

## Typical workflow
1. **Intake and sanity checks**, confirm version, scale to **60 percent**, confirm references, check water tightness  
2. **Split strategy**, define parting lines, flanges, datum scheme, fastener positions, inserts, access for assembly  
3. **Modularity design**, design quick change interfaces so options can be swapped fast, minimise change time in the tunnel  
4. **Stiffness and aero elasticity**, choose thicknesses and local reinforcements, plan materials so parts deflect as intended  
5. **Instrumentation**, route **pressure probe lines**, add tap bosses, connector blocks, cable and tube management  
6. **Manufacturing plan**, select processes, rapid prototyping, CNC, composites, define tolerances and finishes

## Split lines and interfaces
Good splits make the tunnel day easier.

* Keep **datum features** clear, locators and pins, repeatable assembly, minimal shimming  
* Put fasteners where access is easy, design for tool reach and quick swaps  
* Keep sealing and edges clean so the **aero surface** is preserved after assembly  
* Group options into modules so a single change does not force a large disassembly

## Instrumentation and services
Wind tunnel models carry plumbing and sensors.

* **Pressure taps and manifolds**, short and consistent tube lengths, clear labelling, leak test steps in the build doc  
* Provision for **deflection measurement**, optical targets or probes  
* Cable and tube routing that does not compromise assembly, sealing, or surface quality

---

## Automation and templates
Repetition is common, automation pays off.

* Parametric template parts for **flanges, tap bosses, inserts, connectors**  
* CAD macros and scripts for export, drawing stamps, ballooning, file naming  
* Checkers for minimum radii, wall thickness, hole clearances, thread depths

---

## Collaboration touchpoints
* **Aerodevelopment**, confirm intent, agree on swap strategy and test priorities  
* **Surfacing**, resolve issues with patch layouts and continuity near splits  
* **WT testing**, align on change time goals, access, fixtures, spares  
* **Purchasing and suppliers**, lead times, material choices, post processing, deliveries

---

## Skills and interests checklist
* Strong **CAD** skills, assembly design, robust references, clean drawings  
* Practical sense for **modularity**, **assembly**, and **serviceability**  
* Understanding of materials and **manufacturing processes**, SLA, SLS, MJF, CNC, composites  
* Care for **instrumentation**, pressure systems, cable and tube management  
* Habit of documenting, naming, and versioning so others can work fast
