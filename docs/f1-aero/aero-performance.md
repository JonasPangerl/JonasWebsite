# Aero Performance

Aero Performance connects the factory with the track, the focus is the actual race car and its aerodynamic behaviour in real conditions. The group prepares events in advance, supports the car live during sessions, and feeds learning back to the factory.

## Preparation, before the event
* Build aero run plans for the circuit, expected ride heights, steering ranges, yaw distributions, speed points,
* Define downforce levels, for example low or high configurations, target the best lap time for the expected conditions,
* Prepare **cooling levels** and specs, predict temperature margins for engine and brakes,
* Run simulations to explore trade offs, aero maps for load and balance, drag versus top speed, sensitivity to wind and temperature,
* Align references with CFD and WT so comparisons and corrections are consistent.

## At the track, live operations
* Select aero and cooling levels based on ambient conditions, track evolution, and forecast,
* Monitor live telemetry and run sheets, validate that the car sits in the intended aero window,
* Track consistency across sessions and stints, understand drift and reset conditions, support setup choices,
* Diagnose issues in real time, if a part is damaged, use load cells, suspension sensors, and pressure taps to estimate aero loss and 
* decide whether to pit or stay out.

## Correlation, closing the loop
Some teams handle correlation inside Aero Performance, some do it jointly with CFD and WT.
The group compares track behaviour with factory predictions,
* Align conditions and references, temperatures, ride heights, yaw, steer,
* Compare forces and balances against CFD and WT expectations,
* Identify where models are off and feed findings back to the factory.

## Collaboration touchpoints
* **Vehicle Performance**, align on lap time models, tyre behaviour, and strategy constraints,
* **Aero development**, communicate track sensitivities and priorities, request options where the car needs help,
* **CFD**, share deviations and needed studies, keep references aligned for correlation,
* **WT testing**, agree on references and corrections used at the track, request checks when needed,

## Skills and interests
* Solid understanding of **aerodynamics** and **flow physics**, ability to read sensitivity not only single points,
* Practical **coding** for automation and data handling, Python is very useful for pipelines and plots,
* Familiarity with **data acquisition** and telemetry, comfort with sensors and signals,
* Awareness of **strategy** and **vehicle performance** context, so aero choices are judged by lap time, not by isolated forces.
