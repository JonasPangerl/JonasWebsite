# Wind Tunnel Testing

*Personal view, high level sketch only.*

FIA limits drive efficiency, ATR periods are about eight weeks, with allocations for **runs**, **wind on time**, and **occupancy**. A **run** is counted when the tunnel speed drops below a threshold and then rises above it again. The model scale is limited to **60%**.

**Goals**, no wasted runs, high model quality, high repeatability, short change times, maximum useful data per run.

**Typical condition data**, surface pressures via pressure taps, volume probes for CpT, part deflections, flow field data via probes or PIV, all feeding **CFD correlation** and flow understanding.
