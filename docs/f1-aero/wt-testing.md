# Wind Tunnel Testing

The wind tunnel team operates the facility, they integrate and maintain measurement systems, they ensure runs are reliable, repeatable, and efficient. They keep boundary layer control, rolling road systems, balances, drives, safety, and software in good shape, and they optimise procedures so runs are short while still capturing all important conditions.

## Core responsibilities

* **Facility operation**, schedule, startup and shutdown, monitoring of fans, drives, controls, safety systems,  
* **Model responsibility**, the wind tunnel model is a different car than the race car, it matches the outer surfaces but is a purpose built test article with its own structure, services, and interfaces,  
* **Change management**, quick and clean swaps, fixtures and tools that minimise change time, clear checklists for each change,  
* **Calibration and QA**, balances, pressure systems, optical systems, rolling road alignment, leak checks, repeatability studies,  
* **Data integrity**, synchronised acquisition across systems, reference alignment, automated sanity checks.

## Systems they look after

* **Boundary layer control**, suction slots and plenums, control logic, health checks,  
* **Rolling road**, belt tracking, speed control, force and moment corrections, thermal management,  
* **Balances and load paths**, load cells, six component balances, alignment and tare procedures,  
* **Pressure systems**, taps, manifolds, tubing, conditioning, leak tests,  
* **Optical measurement**, PIV or deflection cameras, lighting and seeding systems,  
* **Flow probes**, total and static pressure probes, five hole probes, traverses and positioning,  
* **Environment**, temperature and humidity monitoring, repeatable conditioning where possible.

## Software and automation
WT testing benefits from automation everywhere,

* **Run control**, scripted sequences for condition sweeps, automatic checks before each acquisition,  
* **Acquisition**, unified triggers and timestamps, loss detection and retries,  
* **Procedures**, digital checklists, interlocks, reminders,  
* **Post processing**, first pass results available right after a run, plots and deltas against a reference,  
* **Maintenance**, dashboards for health, calibrations due, sensor drift.

## Measurement techniques and quality
The team integrates techniques to see not only forces but also flow behaviour,  

* **Forces and moments**, primary quality gate for development decisions,  
* **Surface pressures**, dense tap fields on selected parts, quick diagnostics for trends,  
* **Deflection measurement**, optical targets or displacement probes to separate aero effect from structural movement,  
* **PIV or probe based flow**, targeted planes to understand the volume flow field.

## Continuous improvement and new tech
WT teams scout and trial new methods from vendors and other industries, 

* Evaluate practicality and gain, integrate into procedures, train users, measure impact on repeatability and change time,

## Collaboration touchpoints

* **Aero development**, align on run plans and priorities, agree on references and comparisons,  
* **Model Design**, plan splits and interfaces that reduce change time, plan instrumentation early,  
* **CFD group**, align conditions for correlation, share data.

## Skills and interests checklist

* Understanding of **aerodynamics** and test methods,  
* Comfort with **electronics** and **instrumentation**, hands on attitude,  
* Interest in **process optimisation** and **automation**,  
* Basic **coding** for scripts and data handling,  
* Care for **measurement quality**, calibration, traceability, documentation.
